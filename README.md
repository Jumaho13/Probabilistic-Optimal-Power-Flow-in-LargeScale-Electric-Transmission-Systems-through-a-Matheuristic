Abstract— A new optimization methodology to solve the AC
optimal power flow (OPF) problem considering renewable energy
sources (RES) is proposed. The formulation of OPF problem
comprises the minimization of power generation costs and gases
emissions considering a set of operational and physical constraints.
This minimization is achieved through the control of power dispatch
generators, position changing of the tap transformers, and
controllable reactive shunt compensation. Uncertainties in RES and
demand are modeled using the (2m+1) point-estimate method. The
mathematical formulation of the OPF is a mixed-integer non-linear
programming (MINLP) multi-objective model. To solve this
problem efficiently, a matheuristic approach algorithm is proposed,
combining a classic non-linear OPF model and the Variable
Neighborhood Descent (VND) meta-heuristic algorithm. The
potential of the proposed algorithm is shown through numerical
experiments carried out using the IEEE 300-bus systems.
